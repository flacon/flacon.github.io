* Now the program does not use external utilities to calculate ReplayGain, instead the built-in method is used. This accelerated the conversion process and reduced the number of dependencies.  
  _For package maintainers: Note that metaflac, mp3gain, vorbisgain and wvgain are no longer needed._
* Improved error handling. Before starting the conversion, you can view all errors and warnings in one window.
* Fixed bug: When changing the "Artist" field, the "Album Artist" field mistakenly becomes "Multiple Values"
* Fixed bug: In macOS, the size of the main window was not saved.
* Translations updated
