* Added informative error messages when the program can't load an audio file:
  * The audio file does not exist.
  * The audio file may be corrupted or an unsupported audio format.
  * Decoder program is not installed.
  * Decoder program is installed in the settings but binary file does not exist.
* Improved warning messages:
  *   Do not show a warning if the output format does not support the quality of the input HD audio, but you have set the correct bits per sample and sample rate in the preferences.
* Redesigned the logic of loading CUE files containing multiple files, for example, 2 sides of an LP. Now they are displayed as a single list, have a single track numbering, and allow you to change album tags in a single operation.
* Fixed: Flacon refuses to compute ReplayGain for no good reason
* Improved search for covers arts.
* Added better icons for dark themes.
* Added a few codepages for some East Asian languages.
* Translations updated.
