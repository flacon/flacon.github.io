* Added support for [pre-emphasis CD images](https://wiki.hydrogenaud.io/index.php?title=Pre-emphasis). 
* Added support for embedded CUE for input and output FLAC files. If your FLAC file contains a CUE in the metadata, then the program can use it.
* You can not only copy the cover image to a file, but also embed it in the output FLAC files.
* Improved the preferences dialog. The settings are divided into separate tabs.
* Now you can manually input the Disc ID in case the CUE file does not contain one.
* Use https://gnudb.gnudb.org by default as CDDB server.
* Fixed: When converting audio, the image is not copied to the destination folder.
* A number of minor improvements and bug fixes.
* Translations updated.
